## TODOs:


Now, let's talk about performance. The current implementation using EntityUniquenessService and the findByCategoryNameAndRestaurant method in IngredientCategoryRepository is a reasonable approach. However, there are a few things we can do to potentially improve performance:
1. Database Indexing:
   Ensure Proper Indexing: Make sure you have a database index on the columns involved in the unique constraint (categoryName and restaurant_id in your ingredient_category table). This index will significantly speed up the database's search for duplicates.
   Composite Index: Consider creating a composite index on both columns together. This can be even more efficient than separate indexes, especially if you frequently query based on both categoryName and restaurant_id.
2. Caching (Consider Carefully):
   Hibernate Second-Level Cache: If you have a large number of ingredient categories and find that the uniqueness check is a performance bottleneck, you could explore using Hibernate's second-level cache. This would cache the results of the findByCategoryNameAndRestaurant query, reducing the number of database hits.
   Caching Trade-offs: Be aware that caching introduces complexity and potential data consistency issues. If you decide to use caching, make sure you understand how to manage it properly (e.g., cache invalidation strategies) to avoid serving stale data.
3. Code Optimization (Minor):
   Direct Repository Call: In your createIngredientCategory method, you could potentially bypass the EntityUniquenessService and directly call the findByCategoryNameAndRestaurant method on the IngredientCategoryRepository. This would eliminate a small amount of overhead, but it might reduce the reusability of your uniqueness check logic.
4. Database Optimization:
   Database Tuning: General database tuning (e.g., optimizing database configuration, query planner settings) can also impact performance. However, this is a broader topic and might not be necessary for your specific use case.

   The current implementation is functional and likely performs well for a reasonable number of ingredient categories. We can further optimize it with indexing and potentially caching. The choice to use caching depends on specific performance needs and willingness to manage the added complexity.
